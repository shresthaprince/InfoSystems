# Information System Development Methodologies

## Problem Definition

### Objectives
The travel company is planning to develop this information system in order to improve the call flow rate to the Relationship Managers(RM's). The company has a variety of holiday packages on offer because of which there are different types of requests and enquiries from customers. Relationship managers are more informed about certain destinations than others so it poses a problem when a customer is connected to a RM who has minimal knowledge of the destination they wish to enquire about leading to diverted calls and longer call time. Therefore, the main objective of the information system is to connect the customer with an appropriate RM to facilitate faster and efficient call flow. This can be achieved by implementing the Profiler Tool with the system to match the customer profile with the RM profile.
