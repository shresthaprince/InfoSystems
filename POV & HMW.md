## POV Statements
## Customer POV
* I want adequate information on the holiday packages so I can make a decision
* I want to talk to the same RM when revisiting because he understands me better
* I wish that I was connected to an RM that is more tailored to my needs and traits
* We had to wait about 30 minutes to be connected to an operator
* I want my account to be secured behind security questions
* I want someone that understands me best
## RM POV
* I wish our system was able to integrate booking sites for hotels, tours and travel all in our system
* I had to reconnect 3 callers to other RM’s today because I did not know much about their desired destinations
* I want more details about the customer’s information available when getting calls
* It would be nice to prioritise customers based on how likely they are to purchase more packages
* It would be great if we get connected to customers who are enquiring about destinations we are familiar with
