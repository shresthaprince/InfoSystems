## Reflection
* Assuming that RM's are able to sort Profiler tool by what they believe they are confident in. As the questionaire is only completed upon hiring --> RM's may have learnt about new information making them confident with a different demographic
* Assuming that Hotels/Tours/Accomodation sites are integrated within systems allowing a reduced caller wait time and a smoother customer interaction
* Assuming that the interactive voice assistant is able to decipher and analyse the customer profile → Put through to relevant RM with experience
* Assuming that RM’s are able to see a set of transaction history, quote history, and geographic preferences of customers, that will provide RM’s with a suggestion of destinations that match the customer the most. Increasing the chances of the sale going through.
