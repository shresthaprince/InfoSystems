## Reflection
* Assuming that RM's are able to sort Profiler tool by what they believe they are confident in. As the questionaire is only completed upon hiring --> RM's may have learnt about new information making them confident with a different demographic
* Assuming that Hotels/Tours/Accomodation sites are integrated within systems allowing a reduced caller wait time and a smoother customer interaction
* Assuming that the interactive voice assistant is able to decipher and analyse the customer profile → Put through to relevant RM with experience
* Assuming that RM’s are able to see a set of transaction history, quote history, and geographic preferences of customers, that will provide RM’s with a suggestion of destinations that match the customer the most. Increasing the chances of the sale going through.
* We have decided to focus on two stakeholders which is the RM and the customer to make it easier for us to evaluate their roles
* We decided that we would each add a few dot points into every aspect of the empathy map to make the workload easy and fair
* We assumed the roles of each stakeholder and imagined their conversation and interaction to come up with the empathy map
* We used personal experience as a caller to come up with POV’s for the customer
* We came up with a list of stakeholders such as Customers, RM’s, Developers and decided to focus on Customer and RM’s as they are the most relevant
* We made the assumption that the old system was not able to handle multiple inbound calls in an efficient way and was not able to allocate customers based on likelihood of purchase
* We used personal work experience when thinking of the relationship managers POV
