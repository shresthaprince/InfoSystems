## Reflection
* Assuming that RM's are able to sort Profiler tool by what they believe they are confident in. As the questionaire is only completed upon hiring --> RM's may have learnt about new information making them confident with a different demographic
* Assuming that Hotels/Tours/Accomodation sites are integrated within systems allowing a reduced caller wait time and a smoother customer interaction
